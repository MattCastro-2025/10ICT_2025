    <h2> I've shown loyalty and pride when it comes to supporting the house swimming competitions. With this pillar I show encouragement and cheer to my teammates who are competing in the sports. 
        I show pride by wearing the uniform of my house colour and I bring devotion. Sometimes we win and lose but we moved on and always showed our true loyalty to our house and to our School Sacred Heart College.</h2>
